# About: 
Pokémon Iris is a recreation of a Pokémon styled turn-based battle system. I developed this with the aim of writing clean, modular code and to apply concepts that I have learned over the years. A YouTube video showcasing some gameplay and more projects can be found [here](https://youtu.be/mtVx2tPJXqU)

# Features:
- UI
  - Custom keyboard only Input Module.
  - Text typewriter with correct word wrapping.
- Tweening
  - Custom Tweening implementation using built-in coroutines.
- Abilities
  - ScriptableObject abilities, effects and pokémon for easy creation.
- Scene Management
  - Scene transitions and state preservation.

# How to use:
1. Install Unity version 2022.2 or later.
2. Download or clone repository.

# Issues:
The original sprites have been omitted, therefore when opening the project images and ScriptableObjects will have missing references.
